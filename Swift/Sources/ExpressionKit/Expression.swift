// This file provides backward compatibility extensions
// The main Expression implementation is in ExpressionKit.swift

// Note: The main Expression class in ExpressionKit.swift already handles both 
// IEnvironment and EnvironmentProtocol through the adapter pattern, so this
// file is mainly for any additional backward compatibility needs.
